# ðŸŽµ Genre-Based Chord Progression Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to classify music genres based on chord progressions, leveraging AI-driven insights to empower musicians in their creative processes.

## Introduction
Chord progressions are strong indicators of music genres. Our model focuses specifically on classifying songs' genres using their chord structures, moving beyond traditional methods that rely heavily on lyrics.

## Problem Definition
Musicians face challenges in creating music that aligns with specific genres. Our solution trains an algorithm to classify chord progressions, providing real-time feedback and streamlining the creative process.

## Dataset
- **Chords and Lyrics Dataset**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eitanbentora/chords-and-lyrics-dataset)
- **Lakh MIDI Dataset**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/lakh-midi-clean/data)

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**: Chord embeddings, data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, and feature engineering.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.

## Results
We aim for an accuracy greater than 70%, with uniform genre representation and precision/recall scores above 0.8. Expected results include high accuracy for distinct genres and minimized misclassification.
